## Scope of This Repository

This repository focuses on architectural patterns for enterprise integration systems,
including AI-assisted data transformation, error-handling discipline, and event-driven
integration reliability. The examples are intended to demonstrate design intent and
production guardrails rather than end-user tooling.

# Integration Architecture Utilities

This repository contains reusable patterns and utilities for:
• AI-generated DataWeave guardrails
• Error handling and retry discipline
• Kafka and AsyncAPI-based integrations
• Production-grade MuleSoft architecture patterns

These examples reflect real-world enterprise integration practices.
